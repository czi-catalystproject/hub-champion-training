## Asynchronous support during self-study

We will use a collaborative note-taking document, to share answers to exercises during this workshop. A CodiMD template can be found [here](https://codimd.carpentries.org/PJguPN3MQmetgJil9YrDaA). Make sure you generate a fresh copy before the workshop and share this with your learners.

During the self-guided study portion of the workshop, make sure to check the CodiMD regularly to assess progress and respond to any questions.

## Pre-workshop tasks

You may use the following email template to communicate with learners 1 week before the workshop.

## Community Showcase Hub setup

Hub Champions will need access to the 2i2c [Community Showcase Hub](https://showcase.2i2c.cloud) to complete this training.

To grant access to this hub, instructors will need to add learners to this [GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-community-showcase/teams/access-2i2c-showcase). Adding members to this team requires Owner/Maintainer permissions – if you have trouble then please send an email to [support@2i2c.org](mailto:support@2i2c.org).

During the lesson, [](episode-access), Hub Champions will be asked to invite the user `jnywong-test` to the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/2i2c-community-showcase). Please ensure this account is removed from the organization prior to the workshop. Similarly, Hub Champions will be asked to add and remove `jmunroe-testuser` from the [GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-community-showcase/teams/access-2i2c-showcase).
