## Communication channels

We will primarily use Slack for communications with learners to encourage a "cohort" effect and capture discussions that would otherwise disappear from Zoom/Google Meet chat. However, we recognise that learners may join the synchronous sessions on their phones and therefore the Zoom/Google Meet chat is useful in this case.
