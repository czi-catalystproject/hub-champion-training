# Setup

<!-- word count: 83 -->

Before joining the training, participants should be able to:

- Access the 2i2c [Community Showcase Hub](https://showcase.2i2c.cloud) using their GitHub account
- Know basic Git, such as pushing and pulling to a remote GitHub repository
- Find the shared collaborative note-taking document
- Access the Slack Channel for asynchronous support
- Use a web browser and video conferencing, e.g. Zoom
- Read the [2i2c Code of Conduct](https://compass.2i2c.org/code-of-conduct/).

If you have trouble with any of these steps, please contact the training instructor. 

## Communication channels

We will primarily use Slack for communications with learners to encourage a "cohort" effect and capture discussions that would otherwise disappear from Zoom/Google Meet chat. However, we recognise that learners may join the synchronous sessions on their phones and therefore the Zoom/Google Meet chat is useful in this case.
