## Exercises

::::{dropdown} Why is my programme running slow?
:open:

Suppose a user writes a program to analyze a dataset. On their laptop using testing data the program works and is reasonably fast. When the user tries to run this same program on a real dataset their JupyterHub environment is it frustratingly slow.
Why is their interactive computing session being so slow?

What is the solution to this exercise?

a. It is caused by a poor internet connection between my home computer and the cloud.
b. Too many other users are using the cloud server at the same time.
c. I am trying to a computationally intensive task and the cloud computer has poor hardware.
d. I am accessing a very large file that is not local to the cloud server being used.
