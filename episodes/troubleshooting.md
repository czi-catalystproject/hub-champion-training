::::{dropdown} Where to go for help?
:open:

A user wants to use a software application that is not currently available on the hub. Rearrange the following statements in the order of action you would escalate support for this person:

1. Contact the 2i2c technical support desk for assistance
1. Signpost the user to the relevant documentation in the 2i2c Service Guide
1. Arrange one-to-one support to guide the user through the process of pulling a custom container to the hub
1. Find a custom container that includes the requested software application and provide the information needed to pull this container to the hub to the user

:::{dropdown} Solution

There are different ways in which you can approach this support request depending on your technical capacity and your own judgement. However we recommend that you *Contact the 2i2c technical support desk for assistance* as a last resort.
