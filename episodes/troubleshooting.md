::::{admonition} Exercise: How did it go?
:class: exercise

Take a few minutes to reflect on your experience following the training on your own then, in pairs, discuss the following points:

- What did you learn that was new to you?
- What was confusing about the training?
- What questions do you have about hub management?
- Which areas would you like to explore further?
- Do you think your users would benefit from this lesson?

Prepare to summarise and share with the rest of the workshop.

::::

The workshop instructor will now take some time to address a few of the common points that emerged from the discussion in the above exercise. During this time, note down how the instructor is troubleshooting and providing support to resolve an issue. Pay attention to

- whether the issue was already covered in the Hub Champion Training
- any further resources that were referenced
- the level of detail in the response
- their use of language and communication skills.

Nobody is perfect ‚Äì there is no perfect way for troubleshooting and providing user support! Prior skills and support requirements can vary significantly and part of your role as Hub Champion is helping users to help each other, as well as representing and escalating support requests to 2i2c for more technical issues.

Here are some tips for success:

- avoid dismissive language ("you *just* need to do this...", "*obviously* you have to...")
- admit what you don't know ‚Äì it's also useful for learners to watch a Hub Champion use problem-solving skills and seek out [](ref:resources) to find the answer
- if you need to request technical support from 2i2c, then follow the support process and open a ticket [here](https://docs.2i2c.org/support/).

::::{admonition} Exercise: Where to go for help?
:class: exercise

A user wants to use a software application that is not currently available on the hub. Rearrange the following statements in the order of action you would escalate support for this person:

1. Contact the 2i2c technical support desk for assistance
1. Direct the user to the relevant documentation in the 2i2c Service Guide
1. Provide one-to-one support to guide the user through the process of pulling a custom container to the hub
1. Find a custom container that includes the requested software application and provide the information needed to pull this container to the hub to the user

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: solution, dropdown

There are different ways in which you can approach this support request depending on your technical capacity and your own judgment. However, we recommend that you *Contact the 2i2c technical support desk for assistance* as a last resort, since there are plenty of [further resources](ref:resources) to help you before you get to this point.

## Looking forward

Let's take the time to prepare a strategy for how you would like to guide and support your community after this training. Writing a plan will help provide clarity in your approach. Use the **SMART** method to write your objectives and keep your goals realistic and achievable:

Specific
: Clearly describe what needs to be done

Measurable
: It should be possible to determine whether the specified goal has been achieved

Attainable
: What are you realistically capable of?

Relevant
: Make sure that what you commit to is within the scope of your role

Time-bound
: Set a timeframe for your goal to be reached 

<!-- TODO: is there an equivalent approach in Spanish? -->

::::{admonition} Exercise: Plan your support process
:class: exercise

Build a plan for how you will support the use of your hub amongst your community. Begin by trying to answer the following questions:

- How will you communicate with your users?
- Where will your users report issues?
- What needs do you anticipate from your users? How can you set them up for success?
- How will you track whether an issue gets resolved promptly?
- What resources are available to help you when you need help?
- When should you ask for technical assistance from 2i2c?
- How much time can you commit to support activities?
- Will you set expectations of users' conduct and interactions?
- How will you gather feedback to improve your support process?

Considering your responses to the prompts above, identify which of the following resources you already have access to and which you would need to create/obtain:

- communications platforms and channels
- tools for tracking issues/support requests
- documentation
- training

Is there anything else you need to support hub users?
