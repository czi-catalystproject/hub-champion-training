Questions

- Where do I store files on the hub?
- How do I transfer data to and from the hub?
- How do I authorise GitHub to push and pull code to the hub?

:::{grid-item}
Objectives

- Recognise and locate your home directory in the JupyterLab and RStudio user interface
- Distribute read-only datasets to all hub users in a shared directory
- Push and pull GitHub repositories with `gh-scoped-creds`

## Home directory

A hub server comes with its own filesystem that is private to the user and not shared with other hub users. Every user on the hub is given the username `jovyan`[^jovyan] and the file path where their home directory is located at

```shell
/home/jovyan
```

[^jovyan]: Fun fact: `jovyan` is a play on the word "Jovian", which is the adjective form of the planet Jupiter ü™ê. The word `jovyan` is used to describe members of the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) community at large.

Both the JupyterLab and RStudio user interfaces will automatically open the file explorer in the user's home directory in the first instance when a server is launched (see {numref}`fig-jupyterlab` and {numref}`fig-rstudio`).

Files saved in the home directory are persistent and are available on the hub each time a user shuts down and starts a server.

The storage quota for home directories is **limited to 10 GB**, therefore this space is suitable for small files and datasets and not suitable for storing large datasets. 

::::{dropdown} Exercise: What can you store in your home directory?
:open:

Select all that apply:

- [ ] Notebooks
- [ ] Code
- [ ] Large and/or shared datasets with read-write permissions
- [ ] Text files
- [ ] Small datasets
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Read-only datasets, e.g for teaching
- [ ] Temporary data, e.g. intermediate results from a calculation

:::{dropdown} Solution

- [x] Notebooks
- [x] Code
- [ ] Large and/or shared datasets with read-write permissions ‚Äì *consider using Cloud Object Storage or other cloud-native storage solutions*
- [x] Text files
- [x] Small datasets
- [x] Configuration files
- [ ] Read-only datasets, e.g for teaching ‚Äì *consider placing these files in the `~/shared` directory*
- [ ] Temporary data, e.g. intermediate results from a calculation ‚Äì *consider using the `/tmp` directory*

## Shared directory

:::{figure} ../media/episodes/transfer_data/shared.png
:alt: The shared-readwrite folder appears for Hub Champions only.
:figclass: margin

The *shared-readwrite* folder appears for Hub Champions only.
:::

All hub users have access to a common *shared* directory from their home directory. This is a read-only directory where users can access large files or datasets for their work and its contents cannot be accidentally modified or deleted.

Hub Champions can populate the *shared directory* by placing files in the *shared-readwrite* directory that appears only in their home directory.

:::{tip}
**Upload data to the hub**

Upload files to the hub by

- (JupyterLab) clicking the ![*upload*](../media/episodes/transfer_data/jlab-upload.png) button at the top of the file explorer
- (RStudio) clicking the ![*upload*](../media/episodes/transfer_data/rstudio-upload.png) button at the top of the file explorer.

**Download data from the hub**

Download files from the hub by

- (JupyterLab) right-clicking on the target file/folder and clicking the ![*download*](../media/episodes/transfer_data/jlab-download.png) button
- (RStudio) checking the box next to the target file/folder, clicking the ![*settings*](../media/episodes/transfer_data/rstudio-cog.png) button, choosing the *Export...* option and confirming the filename in the following dialog box.

:::

:::{dropdown} Exercise: Data requirements
:open:

Think about the data that you or your community require for your/their work.

- What type of data is it? E.g. tabular data (.csv, .xls), images (.png, .jpg, .bmp), other scientific data formats (.h5, .nc, .fastq)
- How large is a typical dataset?
- Where is the data stored?
- Is the same dataset used by a group of collaborators?

Write up your thoughts in our shared collaborative document.

## Share and manage code with GitHub

GitHub is a popular *hosting platform* for creating, storing, managing and sharing code with collaborators. Code developed on a hub can be synchronised with a remote repository on GitHub, and changes are tracked in a process known as version control. This allows users to compare and even restore different versions of the code and facilitates collaborative work across different machines. Git is a *version control tool* that enables the synchronisation of code with GitHub. On a hub, version control of code is possible by using Git extensions to the user interface. Learn more about how to use these:

 - [Git extension for JupyterLab](https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/#git-workflow)
 - [Git extension for RStudio](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/version-control.html#integrations).

:::{margin}
We recommend performing git operations using the HTTPS protocol and not SSH, since on the hub HTTPS will always work behind a firewall or proxy.
:::

When a user pulls and pushes code to a remote repository on GitHub, they will be prompted to provide their GitHub credentials.

:::{warning}
*We do not recommend entering your GitHub credentials (GitHub password, personal access tokens or otherwise) on any kind of shared infrastructure (e.g. private and public cloud, HPC, any remote machine)* as this information will be at risk.

For JupyterLab, we highly advise using `gh-scoped-creds` for authentication on our hubs.

<!-- TODO: For RStudio, we recommend...  -->
:::

### Using `gh-scoped-creds`

Authorisation to pull and push to GitHub is handled with [`gh-scoped-creds`](https://github.com/yuvipanda/gh-scoped-creds/).

1. Open a Terminal.
1. Run the command `gh-scoped-creds`.
1. The following prompt will appear
   ```shell
   jovyan@jupyter-username:~/my-repo$ gh-scoped-creds
   You have 15 minutes to go to https://github.com/login/device and enter the code: XXXX-XXXX
   Waiting....
   ```
   Copy the code from the prompt and paste it into [https://github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device) as instructed.
1. Authorise the hub to access GitHub by clicking the green button with the label *Authorize <name of hub>*.
1. You should now be able to pull and push to GitHub from the hub without entering your credentials.

Authorisation will automatically expire after 8 hours (or when your JupyterHub server stops), and you'll have to repeat these steps
to renew.

:::{hint}
If you receive a `Permission denied` error after following these steps, then `gh-scoped-creds` has not been enabled for your hub. Please contact your Hub Champion to request this feature.
:::

### Enabling `gh-scoped-creds` for your hub

There are some extra steps for Hub Champions to enable `gh-scoped-creds` for their hub (requires GitHub organisation owner permissions).

1. Check that `gh-scoped-creds` is not already enabled for your hub by opening a Terminal and running
   ```shell
   jovyan@jupyter-username:~$ echo $GH_SCOPED_CREDS_CLIENT_ID
   ```
   
   If this returns nothing, then follow the next step. If this returns a client ID of the form `Iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, then go to Step 3.
1. Send a ticket to the [2i2c support desk](https://docs.2i2c.org/support/) and log a feature request for `gh-scoped-creds`. 2i2c will create a GitHub App and update the hub configuration to make the `GH_SCOPED_CREDS_CLIENT_ID` and `GH_SCOPED_CREDS_APP_URL` environment variables available in your hub.
1. [Install the GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-a-github-app-from-a-third-party) to your GitHub organisation (requires GitHub organisation owner permissions).
   - Navigate to the GitHub App URL provided by 2i2c, which looks like `https://github.com/apps/<gh-app-name>`.
   - Click on the grey *Configure* button to install the GitHub app.
   - Select the GitHub organisation that you would like to enable `gh-scoped-creds` for
     ```{image} ../media/episodes/transfer_data/git-install-app-1.png

     :align: center
     :alt: Screenshot of the page to install a GitHub App showing how you can select the organisation to enable `gh-scoped-creds` for.
     ```
   - Choose whether to enable `gh-scoped-creds` for all repositories in your organisation or for only specific repositories and check that `Read and write access to code` is enabled.
     ```{image} ../media/episodes/transfer_data/git-install-app-2.png
     :width: 50%
     :align: center
     :alt: Screenshot of the page to install a GitHub App showing where to select the repositories you want to enable `gh-scoped-creds` for and check for which read-write permissions there are.
     ```
   - Click the green button labelled *Install*.
1. `gh-scoped-creds` is now enabled for your hub.

:::{note}
If you wish to review the GitHub App settings, then you can locate your organization's installed apps at `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org-name>/settings/installations`.

:::  

<br>

What should you do?

1. Enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token as requested, then click *Save my login temporarily*
1. Click *Cancel*, open a Terminal, enter the command `gh-scoped-creds` and follow the prompt

:::{dropdown} Solution

The correct answer is 2 ‚Äì never enter your GitHub credentials (GitHub password, personal access tokens or otherwise) on any kind of shared infrastructure (e.g. private and public cloud, HPC, any remote machine) as this information will be at risk.
