## Exercises

::::{dropdown} Which of the following statements are True/False?
:open:

a. 2i2c-managed hubs are only available via a single cloud provider.  
b. A hub can be accessed and used by anyone who knows its URL.  
c. Software environments are inflexible and irreproducible.  
d. 2i2c provides operations support for your hub.

:::{dropdown} Solution
a. False – Hubs are built entirely with open source and community-driven tooling. The Right to Replicate gives communities the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere.  
b. False – Hub Champions can control who can access the hub through GitHub or other authentication methods.  
c. False – Software environments are managed by Hub Champions and automatically deployed with containerisation, allowing for scalability across the cloud and reproducible user environments.  
d. True – 2i2c engineers maintain service availability, uptime and operational upgrades. Hub Champions are responsible for hub configuration and management to support their user community.

:::{dropdown} What are the needs of your user community?
:open:

In pairs, discuss and share the following points:
- What domain of expertise does your community have?
- How large is your community? Do they work alone or do they need to collaborate together?
- Does your community work with large datasets?
- Does your community need access to intense computational power?
- Where applicable, are the needs for collaboration, large datasets, and/or computational power consistent across your whole community?
- What are the main software applications your community uses to conduct their work? 
- How familiar is your user community with version control using git/GitHub?

Prepare to summarise and share with the rest of the workshop.

::::{dropdown} In which of the following ways should a Hub Champion support their users?
:open:

a. Providing community guidance on best research software practices for users of your hub.  
b. Troubleshooting and supporting common user issues.  
c. Communicating infrastructure level requests and incidents to 2i2c.  
d. Overseeing user access policy to the hub.

:::{dropdown} Solution

All of the above are things a Hub Champion should do to enable their community to make best use of a hub.
