## Exercises

::::{dropdown} Which of the following statements are True/False?
:open:

a. The infrastructure for running a 2i2c-managed hub is closed source and not replicable across different cloud providers.  
b. Access to the hub can be controlled with authentication and authorisation.  
c. Software environments are inflexible and irreproducible.  
d. 2i2c provides operations support for your hub.
