msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A hub provides interactive computing in the cloud to support research and"
" education workflows for your community. Computational resources, such as"
" the number of {ref}`CPU<glossary:cpu>` cores and "
"{ref}`RAM<glossary:ram>`, can be provisioned on-demand to allow users to "
"scale up or scale down their work as needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a user is logged into the hub, they can launch a server configured "
"with a set number of CPU cores and RAM."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, we will look at the server options available on the "
"[Community Showcase Hub](https://showcase.2i2c.cloud)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Server options presented can vary for different hubs. Nevertheless, the "
"number of CPU cores and RAM available is always clearly stated and the "
"principles for selecting the optimal server resources for your "
"computational work described in this section can still be applied."

msgstr ""

msgid "Small: 4 CPU, 32 GB RAM"

msgid "Exercise: Local versus Cloud computing ‚Äì What's the difference?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"How does the number of CPUs and RAM available on the hub compare with "
"your personal computer? What impact does access to these cloud resources "
"have on your user's work?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Solution"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, more CPU cores available in the cloud allow for more work to "
"be done in *parallel* and reduce time to solution (a CPU-bound program). "
"Parallel computing is where multiple CPU cores can be used simultaneously"
" to solve a computational problem, e.g. running the same processing task "
"on several different datasets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, using more CPU cores does not automatically improve performance "
"since the rate at which information is accessed in RAM can become a "
"limiting factor (a memory-bound program), or simply the program is "
"designed to be executed in *serial* and not in parallel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using cloud resources responsibly"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By selecting a server option, a user is remotely launching a server that "
"is provided by a commercial vendor, such as Google Cloud, AWS or "
"Microsoft Azure. Selecting a larger server incurs a larger financial "
"cost, as well as an environmental cost! Therefore it is important to use "
"cloud resources responsibly to maximize efficiency and minimize carbon "
"emissions."
msgstr ""

"running code efficiently and developing sustainable research software "
"where possible, e.g. test your program first before scaling to a larger "
"job."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exercise: Optimize server resources for your work"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In each scenario, select the option that makes the best use of the "
"following server resources: *Shared Small: 1‚Äì4 CPU, 8‚Äì32 GB RAM, Small: 4"
" CPU, 32 GB RAM, Medium: 16 CPU, 128 GB RAM, Large: 64 CPU, 512 GB RAM*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a. Run a software pipeline where each task requires 2GB of RAM and 60 "
"tasks in total."
msgstr ""

msgid "b. Create documentation and edit text files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"c. Preprocess a dataset consisting of 10,000 images, where each image is "
"16 MB in size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a. *Medium: 16 CPU, 128 GB RAM* ‚Äì the memory required is $ 60 \\times 2 "
"\\, \\mathrm{GB} = 120 \\, \\mathrm{GB}$, therefore the RAM on a *Medium*"
" machine is sufficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"b. *Shared Small: 1‚Äì4 CPU, 8‚Äì32 GB RAM* ‚Äì this is not a computationally "
"intensive task so a machine shared with other users is sufficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"c. *Large: 64 CPU, 512 GB RAM* ‚Äì the total dataset size is $10000 \\times"
" 16 \\, \\mathrm{MB} = 160 000 \\, \\mathrm{MB} = 160 \\, \\mathrm{GB}$, "
"which is too large for the *Medium* machine to hold in memory at once. "
"Alternatively, you could chunk up your dataset and preprocess each batch "
"on a smaller machine, which would be slower. Image preprocessing is often"
" a CPU-bound process in deep learning workflows, so a *Large* machine "
"with more CPU cores is best for performance."

msgid ""
"Sof√≠a wants to run a new program but does not know its maximum memory "
"requirement. She tried compiling it on a Shared Small machine, where it "
"was initially built but then ran out of memory and failed on execution. "
"Which server configuration should Sof√≠a choose to try to run the program "
"again?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Small: 4 CPU, 32 GB RAM* ‚Äì the task failed on a *Shared Small* machine "
"and we recommend sizing up incrementally if you are unsure of the server "
"resources you need."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic server culling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hubs automatically cull servers after a period of inactivity to improve "
"resource utilization and safeguard against excessive cloud costs. This "
"occurs after **1 hour** of user inactivity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Executing a piece of long-running code with a running kernel is not "
"recognised as user activity on the server and so the process is killed "
"after 1 hour. This is a rare use case of interactive computing on a hub, "
"but this limit can be reconfigured for a particular hub upon request by "
"contacting [2i2c support](https://docs.2i2c.org/support)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shutting down a server as a user"

msgid ""
"A user should shut down their server on the hub once they are finished "
"with their work. This can be done manually by applying the following "
"steps."
