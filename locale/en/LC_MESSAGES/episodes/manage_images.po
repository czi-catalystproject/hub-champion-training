msgid "**Questions**"
msgstr ""

msgid "What software environments are available on the hub?"
msgstr ""

msgid "How is containerization helpful for my work?"

msgid "Is there a way to customise my software environment?"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Objectives**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Explain the value of reproducibility with containerized software "
"environments"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select pre-configured JupyterLab or RStudio containers for their hub"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pull a custom container for their hub"
msgstr ""

msgid "Software for research and education"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hub users usually require specific software packages to carry out their "
"work. Installing software on a laptop significantly differs from "
"installing software on a shared resource such as a hub in the cloud, "
"largely because of different"
msgstr ""

msgid "operating systems, e.g. Linux, macOS, Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid "system libraries"
msgstr ""

msgid "filesystems"
msgstr ""

msgid "hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to these factors, a software installation on a user's local machine "
"is difficult to reproduce and the installation process is often poorly "
"documented and out of date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exercise: Software Challenges"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Think about the challenges that you may have faced with using software "
"for your work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Is there a tool that you wanted to use that was not compatible with your "
"operating system?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever struggled to install a piece of software?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Did you and your collaborators fail to reproduce results using the same "
"software application?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Write up your thoughts in our shared collaborative document."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reproduce software environments with containers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Containers are a useful technology for overcoming software challenges in "
"reproducibility, portability and scalability. A container bundles up the "
"software application and its dependencies into a lightweight and "
"standalone package that can be run on any infrastructure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Diagram of how a layer of many user software container environments "
"shares the hub's underlying operating system and server infrastructure."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reproducibility"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An *image* is a reusable and shareable file that outlines the \"recipe\" "
"needed to create a container. This is useful for reproducing a software "
"environment since you can tag and keep track of the different versions of"
" the image."
msgstr ""

msgid "Portability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A container can run on different target systems, such as a laptop, "
"supercomputer or cloud server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scalability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Containers can be scaled up or down to take advantage of the system "
"resources available (i.e. CPUs and RAM)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exercise: Reasons to use containers"
msgstr ""

msgid "Which of the following statements are *True* or *False*?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Containers are lightweight, portable and isolated units of software that "
"can be used on any computer and operating system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An image is a runnable, self-contained software environment created from "
"a container. A container is a shareable \"recipe\" used to create images."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A container enables reproducible modelling or analyses to be carried out "
"on your laptop or in the cloud."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Containers are easily scalable and can be deployed on many machines to "
"distribute work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Solution"
msgstr ""

msgid "*True*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*False* ‚Äì A *container* is a runnable, self-contained software "
"environment or service created from an *image*. An *image* is a shareable"

"As seen in the previous episode, [](episode-server), a user is presented "
"with a list of server options once logged into a hub and each option has "
"an *Image* dropdown box."

"JupyterHub-compatible custom image (see section below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of image options presented can vary for different hubs. Hub "
"Champions can build their own non-default environment and open a support "
"ticket with 2i2c to modify this list to include non-default options ‚Äì "
"this is beyond the scope of this training although further details can be"
" found in the [Hub Service "
"Guide](https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment/)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Choosing a custom image with the \"Other...\" option"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Other...* option allows a user to specify a custom image container "
"to pull into the hub. There are many container registries online that "
"host containerized applications, such as Docker Hub, GitHub, Azure, "
"Amazon and Google Container Registries, Red Hat Quay, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Only containers that are compatible with JupyterHub can be pulled into "
"a hub**. To find JupyterHub-compatible containers you can, e.g."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"browse the list of 2i2c-maintained hub images on [Red Hat "
"Quay](https://quay.io/organization/2i2c)"

msgid "search Docker Hub for the term \"jupyter\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anyone can create a container and publicly share it online, therefore it "
"is important to be cautious about downloading this software onto your "

msgid ""
"An image listed on a container registry may have many different versions "
"associated with it. A `TAG` is used to distinguish these different "
"versions. The name of the container image can also include the `OWNER`. "
"The general format for specifying an image is"
msgstr ""

msgid "OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:TAG\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if a user wanted to pull the [Jupyter PyTorch "
"notebook](https://jupyter-docker-"
"stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-pytorch-"

"/pytorch-notebook:x86_64-pytorch-2.2.0 in the server options page on a "
"hub."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend always explicitly specifying a version number in the `TAG` "
"field rather than using the generic `latest` tag. Providing the version "
"number in the tag is useful for producing informative server logs for "
"debugging purposes and allows you to check whether the correct version of"
" the image is loaded into the hub by running the command"

"Which of the following would you paste into the _Custom Image_ field to "
"pull the latest version of the `handbook-authoring-image` from the list "
