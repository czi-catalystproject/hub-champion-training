msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This episode introduces the concept of a hub for interactive cloud "
"computing and how a hub in the cloud can benefit the user communities a "
"hub champion supports."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can interactive computing in the cloud benefit my community?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Interactive computing is a fundamental way in which researchers and "
"educators use a computer program to perform tasks that include (but are "
"not limited to)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"generating data from experiments or simulations, or gathering data from "
"secondary sources"
msgstr ""

msgid "processing and analysing data using statistical techniques and algorithms"
msgstr ""

msgid "developing data-driven and/or mechanistic predictive models"
msgstr ""

msgid "visualising results to graphically reveal insights."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Real-time interactivity helps information flow back and forth between the"
" user and their work, creating a dynamic and productive environment for "
"research and educational activity. Project Jupyter is an ecosystem of "
"open-source tools that can provide a web-based interactive computational "
"environment, in the form of \"notebooks\", for several languages, namely "
"**Ju**lia, **Py**thon and **R** (hence the name Project **Jupy**te**r**)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cartoon depicting common interactive computing use cases such as data "
"collection, data processing and analysis, predictive modelling and data "
"visualization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the advent of \"big data\", many researchers and educators encounter"
" limitations with using traditional methods for handling data on a local "
"machine or laptop. The size and number of datasets prevalent in "
"disciplines such as genomics, meteorology, healthcare, and environmental "
"sciences, to name a few, are growing at an exponential rate, and "
"consequently, the need for large-scale infrastructure to support "
"continually intensive computational workflows also grows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cloud computing icon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cloud computing is one way of provisioning the system resources needed to"
" meet this demand. This relies on the sharing of on-demand services "
"usually provided by commercial entities such as AWS, Google Cloud and "
"Microsoft Azure. Academics in research and education are often limited in"
" their capacity to sustainably administrate cloud infrastructure at scale"
" and may also wish to support open-source tools and vendor-agnostic "
"infrastructure to protect scientific reproducibility and encourage "
"effective collaboration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where a non-profit initiative such as [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) "
"can help. 2i2c specialises in managing open Jupyter architecture in the "
"cloud specially designed for communities of practice in research and "
"education using open-source tools that allow them to reproduce "
"environments, code and data on different machines. Users can access "
"large-scale compute and storage as needed and workflows are entirely "
"reproducible and supported by using community-driven, open-source "
"technologies."
