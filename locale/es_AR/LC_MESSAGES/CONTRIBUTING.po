"Carpentry][dc-site], and [Library Carpentry][lc-site]) are open source "
"projects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes "
"to existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are "
"all welcome."

msgid "Contributor Agreement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our "
"license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or "
"assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a "
"member of our community. Everyone involved in [The Carpentries][cp-site] "
"agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)."

msgid "How to Contribute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a "
"spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a "
"good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments "
"by email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if "
"you use one of the other methods described below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create one"
"][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems "
"or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][repo-issues]. This allows "
"us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded "
"discussion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change "
"material, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this"
" are [included below](#using-github). For inspiration about changes that "
"need to be made, check out the [list of open issues][issues] across the "
"Carpentries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The "
"Workbench documentation][template-doc]."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where to Contribute"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you wish to change this lesson, add issues and pull requests here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to change the template used for workshop websites, please "
"refer to [The Workbench documentation][template-doc]."
msgstr ""

msgid "What to Contribute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and "
"improving existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and "
"submitting [bug reports][issues] about things that do not work, are not "
"clear, or are missing. If you are looking for ideas, please see [the list"
" of issues for this repository][repo-issues], or the issues for [Data "
"Carpentry][dc-issues], [Library Carpentry][lc-issues], and [Software "
"Carpentry][swc-issues] projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we "
"are smarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and "
"newcomers are particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been"
" using these lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this "
"material can be, so fresh eyes are always welcome."
msgstr ""

msgid "What *Not* to Contribute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical "
"workshop, so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to "
"add to them. As a rule, if you want to introduce a new idea, you must (a)"
" estimate how long it will take to teach and (b) explain what you would "
"take out to make room for it. The first encourages contributors to be "
"honest about requirements; the second, to think hard about priorities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on "
"one platform. Our workshops typically contain a mixture of Windows, "
"macOS, and Linux users; in order to be usable, our lessons must run "
"equally well on all three."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using GitHub"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to "
"Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In "
"brief, we use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each "
"significant change."
msgstr ""

msgid "Commit the change in that branch."
msgstr ""

msgid "Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your "
"branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "NB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each lesson has a team of maintainers who review issues and pull requests"
" or encourage others to do so. The maintainers are community volunteers, "
"and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other Resources"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Carpentries is a global organisation with volunteers and learners all"
" over the world. We share values of inclusivity and a passion for sharing"
" knowledge, teaching and learning. There are several ways to connect with"
" The Carpentries community listed at <https://carpentries.org/connect/> "
"including via social media, slack, newsletters, and email lists. You can "
