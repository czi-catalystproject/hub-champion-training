msgid "María Zambrano"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"She graduated in Computer Science recently and has a support staff "
"position in the biomedical engineering PhD program at the life sciences "
"department in a medium-sized public university in Ecuador."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"María has to assist around 25 students and their advisors in struggling "
"with hardware that is not necessarily old but does not hold the capacity "
"to process the required “big data” for their projects promptly. Also, the"
" projects are very different, so there isn’t a clear one-size-fits-all "
"solution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Hub Champion training will enable María to select and recommend the "
"best software environments and computation resources for the students' "
"project needs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Santiago Hernández"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is a biologist with some self-taught knowledge of Computer Science. He"
" is part of a nonprofit organization working mainly in Mexico but with an"
" internationally distributed team. The team has cross-disciplinary "
"intersections with biology, pharmacy, media studies, and political "
"science."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The community members have different levels of knowledge of interactive "
"computing tools. Because of his better understanding of programming and "
"computing concepts, Santiago was selected as the Hub Champion for the "
"Catalyst Project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Hub Champion training will give Santiago more confidence and tools to"
" make the best use of the hub in his community while he connects with "
"other nonprofit organizations with similar challenges to share "
"strategies."

msgid "Ana Muñoz"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"She is a biochemist working on analyzing water quality on the coast of "
"Peru. She is part of a climate data research group distributed on the "
"Pacific Latin American coast, co-led by two other professors from public "
"and private universities in Chile and Colombia."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The project aims to understand the effects of El Niño on human health. "
"They have been using each university’s computational resources for "
"research, so they often use distinct tools and protocols and lack shared "
"infrastructure and similar training. As part of the Catalyst Project, "
"they want to develop a common workflow across the three universities and "
"find a way to sustain the project for the next two decades due to the "
"long timelines used in climate data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Hub Champion training will give Ana the knowledge to establish a "
"workflow using open-source software that enables collaboration and "
"facilitates reproducibility for the research project."
